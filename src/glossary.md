# Glossary

## A

**AOT (Ahead-Of-Time)**: Costing model where script costs are calculated before execution. Used in ErgoTree versions 0-1.

**AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree used for authenticated dictionaries in Ergo.

## B

**BigInt**: 256-bit signed integer type in ErgoTree.

**Box**: The fundamental UTXO unit in Ergo, containing value, ErgoTree script, tokens, and registers.

## C

**Constant Segregation**: An optimization technique where constants are extracted from ErgoTree expressions and stored separately.

**Context**: The execution environment containing blockchain state, transaction data, and input information.

## D

**DLog (Discrete Logarithm)**: A cryptographic primitive based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in finite groups.

## E

**ErgoScript**: High-level smart contract language with Scala-like syntax.

**ErgoTree**: Serialized bytecode representation of smart contracts.

## F

**Fiat-Shamir Transformation**: Technique to convert interactive proofs into non-interactive proofs.

## G

**GroupElement**: An elliptic curve point on secp256k1.

## H

**Header**: The first byte(s) of ErgoTree that specify version and format flags.

## I

**Interpreter**: The component that evaluates ErgoTree expressions.

## J

**JIT (Just-In-Time)**: Costing model where costs are calculated during execution. Used in ErgoTree version 2+.

## P

**Prover**: Component that generates cryptographic proofs for spending conditions.

**Proposition**: A statement that can be proven true or false.

## S

**Secp256k1**: The elliptic curve used in Ergo (same as Bitcoin).

**SigmaBoolean**: A tree of cryptographic propositions (AND, OR, threshold, DLog, DHT).

**SigmaProp**: Type representing sigma-protocol propositions.

**Sigma Protocol**: Zero-knowledge proof system with three-move structure.

## T

**Type Code**: Unique byte identifier for each type in ErgoTree serialization.

## U

**UTXO**: Unspent Transaction Output model used by Ergo.

**UnsignedBigInt**: 256-bit unsigned integer type (added in v6).

## V

**Verifier**: Component that verifies cryptographic proofs.

**VLQ**: Variable-Length Quantity encoding for integers.
